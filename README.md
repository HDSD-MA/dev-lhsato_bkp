We are going to study Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition] course together. This repository was created to receive all the code files that the instructor creates during the course. Some rules:

  1. You must create and update all files that the author creates;

  
  2. The commit description is as follows:
   - **the first commit description** of the file is always the name of the video: For example, **"20. Our Very First HTML Page"**
   - if you have to commit more than one during the same video, you must add the letter **a, b, c** and so on. For example, the description for **the second commit** of the same video would be: **"20. Our Very First HTML Page a"** , the third would be: **"20. Our Very First HTML Page b"**.
   
   3. Your Github Repository will be similar this picture:
